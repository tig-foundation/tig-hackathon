    "# The Innovation Game (TIG) Hackathon\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This is your Team's dedicated server for the Hackathon\n",
    "\n",
    "The Innovation Game is a high-intensity, fast-paced race taking place over 24 rounds, lasting 2 hours each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hackathon Objective\n",
    "You can play as an Innovator and/or Benchmarker, with the objective of earning the most total points over the Hackathon:\n",
    "* Innovators submit Rust algorithms for solving the featured challenges, earning points based on adoption of those algorithms by Benchmarkers\n",
    "* Benchmarkers compute solutions to random instances of challenges, earning points based on number of solutions submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "* If you are participating as an Innovator, you will want to also play as Benchmarker to affect the adoption of your algorithms!\n",
    "* Algorithms submitted in Round X, will be public in Round X + 1, and usable for benchmarking in Round X + 2\n",
    "* Innovators can only submit 1 algorithm per round\n",
    "* Innovators can iterate on other Innovator's algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hackathon Prizes\n",
    "Top 3 Innovators:\n",
    "1. 500USD worth of TIG + RTX 5070\n",
    "2. 200USD worth of TIG + Gaming Monitor\n",
    "3. 100USD worth of TIG + Gaming Keyboard\n",

    "Top 3 Benchmarkers:\n",
    "1. 500USD worth of TIG\n",
    "2. 200USD worth of TIG\n",
    "3. 100USD worth of TIG\n",
    "\n",
    "Every individual in the top 25 teams across Innovators and Benchmarkers get $10 worth of TIG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Featured Challenges\n",
    "For Encode2025, we have the following 3 challenges (HackerRank/LeetCode style problems):\n",
