// TIG's UI uses the pattern `tig_challenges::<challenge_name>` to automatically detect your algorithm's challenge
use anyhow::{anyhow, Result};
use tig_challenges::satisfiability::*;

pub fn solve_challenge(challenge: &Challenge) -> Result<Option<Solution>> {
    // If you need random numbers, recommend using SmallRng with challenge.seed:
    // use rand::{rngs::SmallRng, Rng, SeedableRng};
    // let mut rng = SmallRng::from_seed(challenge.seed);

    // return Err(<msg>) if your algorithm encounters an error
    // return Ok(None) if your algorithm finds no solution or needs to exit early
    // return Ok(Solution { .. }) if your algorithm finds a solution
    Err(anyhow!("Not implemented"))
}

// Important! Do not include any tests in this file, it will result in your submission being rejected
