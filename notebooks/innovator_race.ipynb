    "1. [Install Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Clone the repo https://github.com/tig-foundation/tig-hackathon on your local machine.\n",
    "4. Make a copy of `tig-algorithms/src/<CHALLENGE>/template.rs` in the same folder and rename to `my_algo.rs`.\n",
    "5. Edit `tig-algorithms/src/<CHALLENGE>/mod.rs` and add a line `pub mod my_algo;`\n",
    "6. Develop `my_algo.rs` locally (you can use `cargo build -p tig-algorithms` to make sure it compiles)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you want to test or submit your algorithm, copy the code up to this server and use the scripts in the challenge notebooks."
